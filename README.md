# Gridscan

Script automating nmap scanning during enumeration phase of penetration tests.

Inspired by "nmapAutomator" by 21y4d!

This project was made as practice for myself as well as allowing me to use this script during OSCP examination without worry of breaking the rules and regulations as it was written by myself.
